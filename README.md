# Team Player Optimization: Football

In the competitive arena of professional football, strategic player acquisition and management
are crucial for a teamâ€™s success. This project harnesses Gurobi optimization techniques to offer
teams a sophisticated, data-driven framework for making informed decisions on player acquisitions, lineups, and coaches. Focusing on multiple objective optimization with a hierarchical
approach and discrete optimization through Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), the project
aims to assess player selections and critically evaluate coaching decisions.
