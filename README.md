# Team Player Optimization: Football

In the competitive arena of professional football, strategic player acquisition and management
are crucial for a team’s success. This project harnesses Gurobi optimization techniques to offer
teams a sophisticated, data-driven framework for making informed decisions on player acquisitions, lineups, and coaches. Focusing on multiple objective optimization with a hierarchical
approach and discrete optimization through Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), the project
aims to assess player selections and critically evaluate coaching decisions.
1. Optimizing Player Selection and Transfers
Manchester City (2016-2017 Season)
Manchester City, a top-tier English football club, faced a pivotal season in 2016-2017, marked by
a transformation under the stewardship of new manager Pep Guardiola. This period represented
a shift towards an innovative playing style, and our analysis centered on utilizing optimization
techniques to assist Guardiola in this transitional phase. The primary goal was twofold: Firstly,
to determine an optimal 25-player squad for registration, aiming to maximize the team’s performance while adhering to budgetary constraints, squad composition requirements, and player
acquisition limits. Secondly, the focus was on devising the best starting 11 for crucial matches,
especially against formidable opponents like Barcelona and Liverpool. By applying optimization
models to comprehensive player data, our objective was to strategically strengthen the team
through targeted transfers, thereby setting the stage for Guardiola to achieve success in the
upcoming seasons.
Manchester United (2016-2017 Season)
In contrast, Manchester United, another Premier League powerhouse, embarked on a different
tactical journey under the guidance of coach Jos´e Mourinho. Similar to Guardiola, Mourinho’s
approach involved a blend of tactical formations, notably shifting between 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3.1
However, while Guardiola’s style is characterized by an emphasis on possession, Mourinho’s
approach is more defensively oriented and geared towards exploiting counter-attacking opportunities. Our analysis with United focused on optimizing a 23-player selection to cater to
Mourinho’s diverse tactical needs. This involved a thorough assessment of player attributes to
enable flexibility in formation and strategy, essential for adapting to different match scenarios.
Such an approach was not only about selecting the best players but also about forming a squad
capable of executing Mourinho’s vision.
